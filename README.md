# html-and-css-project

**My very first project in school.**

## Requirements:

-Flexbox or Grid layout.<br>
-Responsive webbpage (between 360px to 980px).<br>
-Title- and decription-meta-element.<br>
-Heading element.<br>
-Class selectors and Id selectors.<br>
-Img element with alt attribute.<br>
-At least two web pages.<br>

### Comments:

I have done some modifications afterwards in this project. Every page except contact page are modified. <br>

The webpage may look strange, but it's just because the maximum width is only 980px, which was one of the grading criteria in the project.<br>
